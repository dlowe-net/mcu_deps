# Marvel Cinematic Universe Dependency Chart

It can be very difficult to break into the MCU starting in the middle.
This is a chart of what movies depend on what for context.  Just
referencing an event in a movie isn't enough to include an edge - it
must introduce something that influences the plot.  Whether or not a
movie/show "depends on" another is, of course, highly subjective.
Arguments for each are included in the comments of the dot file.

- Colors are by MCU Phase - Red, Orange, Purple, Blue, Green.
- Bolded circles are standalone movies with no dependencies.
